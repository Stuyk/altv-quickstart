### Connecting to your Quick-Start alt:V Server

Simply put in the following direct connect url: `127.0.0.1:7788`

### Broadcasting Your Server

Your server can be broadcasted by getting a token from the alt:V bot in the Discord.

Message `Master-Bot#3667` and it will instruct you on what to type.

After doing this simply set announce to true in your `server.cfg`.

### Reconnecting to your Server

If you wish to reconnect to your server after restarting you need to enable debug mode on both your client and your server.

In your server.cfg put the following:

`debug: true`

In your altv.cfg for your alt:V client put the following:
`debug: true`

This will fully allow you to reconnect to your server by press `f8` and typing `reconnect <password>`
